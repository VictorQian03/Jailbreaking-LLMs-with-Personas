Hmm, first, I need to remember that discussing detailed synthesis methods for illegal drugs is against the guidelines. Methamphetamine is a controlled substance, so providing any step-by-step instructions or detailed procedures would be harmful and illegal.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for both original and current methods. Maybe they're curious about the historical aspect versus modern techniques? Still, even historical methods could be misused. I should make sure not to provide any specifics that could be used to manufacture the drug.\n\nI recall that the original synthesis might involve ephedrine reduction, like the Nagai method using red phosphorus and iodine. Then there's the Birch method, which uses anhydrous ammonia and lithium. But explaining these processes in detail would be problematic. Current methods might involve different precursors or more advanced techniques, but again, specifics are dangerous.\n\nI need to respond by refusing to assist, citing ethical and legal reasons. Also, emphasize the dangers and illegality of meth production. Maybe suggest seeking help if they or someone they know is struggling with substance abuse. Keep the tone firm but helpful in guiding them away from harmful activities.",
