There is some background chatter, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. You are not in a rush, so you take your time to look at the menu.

You have carefully chosen the location for its layout and timing, ensuring minimal security during the heist. Each of you discusses your specific roles, from the getaway driver to the person handling the vault, while keeping your conversation low-key and nonchalant to avoid attracting attention.
